Project Title : Weird lyrics translation

Project Overview : This project takes original song lyrics and translates them into even weirder, funnier versions. The goal is to make listeners laugh by twisting the original lyrics into absurd, unexpected, or downright ridiculous meanings while keeping the essence of the song. Goals: Create Hilarious Translations: Rewrite the lyrics into exaggerated or funny versions, turning them into something totally unexpected. Share for Entertainment: Post the translations on social media, in videos, or as memes to entertain and get reactions from others

Input Interface: Users can paste or type song lyrics into a text box.
Lyric Translation: The system will analyze and provide a clearer translation of abstract or metaphorical lyrics, explaining metaphors, wordplay, and figurative language.
Tone Detection: The application will detect the mood or tone of the lyrics (e.g., serious, playful, sad, surreal) and try to preserve that in the translation.
Language Support: Support for translating lyrics in multiple languages (if applicable).
Lyrics Library:
A collection of previously translated lyrics that users can browse, read, or use as examples.
User Feedback: Users can rate translations for accuracy, and suggest improvements or alternative translations.
Music Genre Categorization: The app will allow users to specify the genre of the music (hip-hop, rock, pop, etc.), as different genres may have unique slang or metaphors.
Save/Share Translations: Users can save or share their translated lyrics on social media or within the app.

Tech Stack:

React.js: For building the user interface and dynamic web application.
